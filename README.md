# Developer HUB
This is a application created for the Electrothon 4.0 international hackathon conducted by NIT Hamirpur.


## Description:

There is no "hub" for developers to catch up on news and things that are going on in the programming field. So we tried to tackle that with this app. 
Also integrated Alan AI, a voice assistant to navigate and open the news artices using just the voice.
